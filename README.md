### About Forbole

Forbole Limited ("Forbole") is a blockchain startup incorporated in Hong Kong in 2017. We advocate for using distributed ledger technology to improve our world which is dominated by a handful of centralized powers. We have three categories of products and services:

#### 1) Staking-as-a-Service

Forbole is a recognized validator and contributor of various proof-of-stake blockchains with a focus in Cosmos, the internet of blockchains. We are currently on Cosmos ecosystem chains including [Cosmos Hub](https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/validators?sort=votingPower&dir=-1_), [Iris Hub](https://iris.bigdipper.live/validators?sort=votingPower&dir=-1), [Terra Money](https://terra.bigdipper.live/validators?sort=votingPower&dir=-1), [Kava](https://testnet-1.kava.bigdipper.live/validators?sort=votingPower&dir=-1), [BitSongs](https://testnet-1.bitsong.bigdipper.live/validators?sort=votingPower&dir=-1), [Sentinel](https://explorer.sentinel.co/validators?sort=votingPower&dir=-1), [Cyber Congress](https://cyberd.ai/validators) and [LikeChain](http://35.226.174.222/).

#### 3) Desmos

Desmos is a public chain currently under development. It is being built with Cosmos SDK with its own modules specifically designed for social networking features. One of the modules is Magpie which provides identity and accountability to validators, delegators and other types of stakeholders with a novel and generalizable temporary key pairing method using browser-based WASM. Desmos will also serve as a regional Hub in South China and Southeast Asia.

### How we work

We are an early-stage startup with worldwide tractions. We are currently a small team across three timezones (HKT, CET, EST). Joining us at this stage means you will be one of the early co-builders of a rising startup of a rising ecosystem in a rising industry. We have a strong sense of decentralization and diversity. There is no micro-management. Every teammate accomplishes the milstomes on her or his own initiative. We work as a distributed team across the globe by using tools such as GitHub and Zoom.
